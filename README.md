### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael. I have a Bachelor of Computer Science from the [University of Waterloo]. Of the "[Big 3]" courses, I took CS 488 (Computer Graphics).

Majority of my full-time industry experience has been writing Modern C++ (11/14/17/20) for consumer electronics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Pre-ablo], a reverse-engineering effort for an early Diablo demo
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my music! I produce electronic music and self-publish on [Bandcamp]

I'm a bit of a digital pack rat so my GitHub is a bit cluttered. To alleviate this, I've tried to use pins to highlight the cream of the crop -- projects I'm proud of or still interested in.
